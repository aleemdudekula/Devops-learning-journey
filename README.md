## 🚀 DevOps Learning Journey – Aleem

I began my career in system support, ensuring production systems remained stable, secure, and operational. Working closely with real-world incidents exposed inefficiencies in manual operations and traditional infrastructure management.

This experience drove my transition into DevOps, where I focus on automating infrastructure, streamlining deployments, and building resilient systems. My work centers on reducing operational overhead through automation, improving system observability, and enabling faster, safer software delivery.

I bridge the gap between operations and development by combining practical troubleshooting experience with modern DevOps engineering practices.
