# 🚀 DevOps Learning Journey — Aleem

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I started my career in **System Support**, maintaining production environments and ensuring systems remained stable, secure, and operational. Working closely with real-world incidents exposed the limitations of manual operations and traditional infrastructure management.

This experience motivated my transition into **DevOps**, where I focus on automation, scalable infrastructure, and reliable software delivery.

My goal is to move from reactive system maintenance to **proactive, automated DevOps engineering**.
