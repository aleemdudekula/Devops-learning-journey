## Hello frd,
Today what i learnt 
## 1. Creating EC2 on hashtag#AWS and 
 # login AWS console login page
 # then go to EC2 instance 
 # click instance and configure u r requirements (OS, ram, cpu, memory)..,
 # create security key file and download either pem file / ppk file 
 # Then launch instance( remeber u r IP later we can use)
## 2. EC2 Configure on my Local system through WSL on windows
 # copy that file on WSL files 
 --> cp /mnt/c/program\ Files/WSL\pemfile
 # configure Ec2 on WSL
 --> sudo ssh -i pemfile machine@ip(ec2-instance-ip)
 # sudo apt update && upgrade -y this update u r machine
## 3. Now move to advance 
 # Ec2 instance connect through on web page(like http-port(80)
 # before that u can check inbound rules in security group where u can 
 add rule 
 --> http - 80 - 0.0.0.0/0(Anywhere IPV4)
## 4. Install Nginx inside u r EC2 instance
 --> sudo apt install nginx -y
 --> sudo systemctl start nginx
## 5. open web browser type: http://ec2-ip-add/
## 6. we can find out welcome ngnix 
 # "Boom u r first Ec2 Instance server" deployed"
## 7. do practice cmds like 
 --> sudo systemctl restart nginx
 --> sudo systemctl stop nginx
 --> sudo systemctl start nginx
 --> sudo systemctl status nginx
## 8. Go to directory /var/ww/html/ u can modified the file index.html
## 9. Go to directiry /var/log/nginx u can access file like error.log & access.log file

## Bonus tip
WSL is far more reliable than GUI tools like MobaXterm for SSH —
 less abstraction, fewer hidden issues.
